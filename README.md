# SpringQAP2

Hi Peter,

This QAP didn't take very log once started.

I used your Github and the class recording of May 23 to help me threw. I tried to write my own as much as I could so I wasn't juts copying your work. I did run into a few issues with port 3000 trying to be used my mutiple files.
Not really sure how but I used the KILL method it push whatver other file was using it off the port and got it to work.
In my logEvents.js you will also see a note of how I tried to have just one type of eventloged not all but failed in the end.
Having a full walk through video was very helpful and let me make sure I was getting the right results.
